<h3> About Me  🚀 </h3>
<p>
Hello! I’m an experienced Java Developer with a Master of Science in Computer Science from Northern Arizona University.

🔭 My career began at Accenture in Hyderabad, India, where I honed my skills in various programming languages like Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was part of a dynamic Java team, involved in researching, analyzing, executing, writing, and testing code. My focus was on developing robust web applications using frameworks like Struts and managing databases with MySQL and PL/SQL.

I have a track record of enhancing efficiency in projects, particularly in the Automobile and E-Commerce sectors, and I take pride in maintaining a 100% success rate in production issue resolution and project delivery.

During my time at Northern Arizona University, I balanced my studies with a Teaching Assistant role. I assisted in Computer Science courses covering Internet Literacy, Algorithms, and Computer Networks. My role involved clarifying complex concepts for students, collaborating with faculty on course content, and fostering an interactive learning environment.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and am always eager to learn new things. My experience has taught me the importance of effective communication, teamwork, and a detail-oriented approach in technology and education.

As I continue my journey in tech, I am open to opportunities and connections that align with my interests in software development and research in computer science.
